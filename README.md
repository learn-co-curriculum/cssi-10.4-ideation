##IDEATION

###Scope
As you use your wonderfully talented and creative brains, don't forget to remember the scope of this project. 
* 4 full days of work time (Monday-Thursday) - It'll go faster than you think
* Functionality should start simply
  * Get user input
  * Apply logic to user input
  * Return something new (and wonderful!)
* In a team of 3. What might workflow look like between your group?  

###MVP CONCEPT 
Focus on the most **basic** functionality of your app, then once that works, you can add features.

###Time to Plan
Don't forget to "Yes-and" everything your team says!

1. Spend 3 minutes listing at least 10 ideas in rapid fire. 
2. When time is up, look at your list and as a group select 3 ideas that you are excited about
3. As a class, half of you share your ideas whole group with the MI, the other half shares with the LI
4. The instructor will think through each app idea and assign a level of difficulty (1-5).
5. After  you see the difficulty of your project and hopefully been inspired by other groups ideas decide on your final project idea, keeping the scope in mind.
